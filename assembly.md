assembling the pan 

parts:
* 2 bottom plate mounting brackets
* 2 flywheels
* 1 motor mount 
* 1 solenoid holder
* 4 pillars
* 1 small gear 
* 1 big gear
* 1 top plate
* 1 bottom plate
* 2 d3536 bldcs (flashhobby) with the mounting bracket and collet 
* 1 nema 17 stepper motor

assembly
1) use self tapping to put the 4 pillars in 
* put the nema motor into the hole in the bottom plate facing up and use bolts to fasten it 
* put the small gear on the shaft and use set screws and nuts to fasten
2) put mounting brackets on bottom plate 
3) put the bldcs together with flywheels and the mounting bracket on
4) use nuts and bolts to tightly clamp the motors down to the motor mount
* nuts and bolts to tighten down the solenoid feeder assembly to the top plate 
- heres where things are bad with the assembly. 
without threaded inserts. its easiest to now fasten the motor mount to the top plate. 
5) now screw in the big gear to the top plate  
but the motor mount is not high enough to get the center bolt in (the bolt that keeps the top and bottom plates axially aligned)
so you need to put the bolt in from the bottom, then the nuts on top
